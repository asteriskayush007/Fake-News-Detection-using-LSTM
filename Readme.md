# 📰 Fake News Detection (LSTM)

A deep learning model using LSTM trained on the Kaggle Fake & Real News Dataset with 97%+ accuracy. Hosted using Streamlit.

## 📦 Features
- LSTM text classifier using TensorFlow/Keras
- Cleaned & preprocessed dataset
- TF-IDF removed for deep learning
- UI built in Streamlit
- Realtime confidence score display

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py


📁 Then ZIP your folder for submission.

## 📥 Download Dataset Files from Google Drive

To download the required datasets (Fake & Real News CSV):

```bash
pip install gdown

### ✅ **Step 5: LinkedIn / Portfolio Post**

Here’s a **LinkedIn-style summary**:

> 🚀 Just completed an exciting deep learning project: **Fake News Detection using LSTM**!
>
> 🔍 Trained on 44,000+ articles from real-world datasets (Kaggle), the model achieved over **97.9% accuracy** using an LSTM neural network.
>
> 💻 Deployed a clean and interactive **Streamlit web app** that detects whether a news article is *real* or *fake* — complete with confidence scores and live predictions.
>
> 🧠 Key Highlights:
> - Clean NLP preprocessing pipeline
> - LSTM + Keras-based model
> - Hosted via Streamlit (no backend required!)
> - Dataset: [Fake & Real News – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
